Hey there, welcome to Ramen House!

As part of my MSc course, I developed a website advocating for Ramen House, a restaurant and studio. Recognising the importance of user experience, the project sought to streamline information delivery and navigation on the website, ensuring that visitors could easily access relevant details about the restaurant's offerings and services. 

Overall, the project sought to address these challenges comprehensively, aiming to elevate the online presence of Ramen House and improve the overall user experience for website visitors.
